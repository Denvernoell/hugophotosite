# Why you should be using VBA

Not too long ago I learned about VBA macros and I was shocked that I could do something to repeat tasks so quickly. After recording macros and trying to deploy them for diffrent projects I found that not everything was self explanitory and that I found some of the answers to questions online and the documentation to be hard to understand. After some time, I have been able to write procedures from scratch and not need to touch the macro recorder until there is an object or property that I don't commonly use.

Since then, I have created many scripts that have turned what were long processes into the press of a button that will complete the process much faster than you would be physically able to complete yourself.

Reasons

- Cut down on the amount of clicking that you do
- Easily repeat processes that you do commonly
- Add logic to your processes

Notes

- I primarily work with Excel objects
- I typically don't declare variables in favor of readability of code and clarity
- I have found that the macro recorder will typically output extraneous code as well as leave out methods that may be better suited to the needs of a procedure
