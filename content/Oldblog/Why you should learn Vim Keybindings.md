# Why you should learn Vim Keybindings

I should start by saying that at the time I am a Civil Engineering student and am by no means a developer. I don't even know lot of languages or programming projects under my belt.

I believe that Vim Keybindings open the door to text editing of any sort as well as other applications or uses.

Where I think that most users can use Vim Keybindings is when browsing the web. This is done by downloading the Vimium extension on the Chrome Webstore. _But I don't use Chrome_ you might say. This app can be used on Brave and tehre are similar extensions on Firefox.

This works by using the typical movements used in vim. My favorites: j=down,k=up, J:left one tab,K:Right one tab

These can also be applied using Auto Hot key to attack various problems.

While going through my photo project, I needed to go through and rotate photos if they were oriented correctly. If you have tried to do this in Windows file explorer, you know how tedious this can be, especially when there are over 10,000 photos. I found that pressing alt,j,j,r,p would rotate the photo 90 degrees. In autohotkey I wrote a simple script to make _j_ go to the next photo _k_ to go to the previous photo, _h_ to rotate the photo. All of this would take place if scroll lock was active. Have you ever used scroll lock? I've never even attempted to used it
